Problem Statement : An elevator is an integral part of buildings that have multiple floors. The elevator car could be in different states, either up or down, or could be stopped on some floor. Anyone can request an elevator car from any floor using the buttons on the panel. The elevator carâ€™s algorithm will set the priority and take action accordingly, so the wait time is minimum. Inside an elevator, there will be a panel for passengers to select the floor on which they want to go. The elevator car will have a fixed capacity for the number of passengers and a display to show on which floor the elevator car is currently located.
